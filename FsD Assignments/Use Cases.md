Use-Case-1:
Task management and tracker 
Description: Two separate logins, one for student and one for admin. 
Admin should be able to assign tasks to student, assignment should be customised in form of drop down or format specified by the admin. 
The assigned task should reflect to student portal. Students should be able to view the assigned tasks and submit it in form of attachment. This attachment should be viewable by the admin for approval. 
Deadlines on student portal with respect to task must be displayed. Once the admin approves the task submission, it should be reflected as approved on student portal. The admin should be able to assign the task in a bulk format and custom filters in terms of department, group or any other specifics by admin. 
Students should have a comprehensive dashboard to have access to their task pending and completed. Admin should have the liberty to view and compare the performance of task submissions by the student in some visual forms. 
Creative ideas are welcome in this use case and you are free to incorporate whatever proposals you have pertaining to this use case. 
You can prepare a wireframe and present tomorrow for 5 minutes if we have competitors for this use case or else it will be granted to those who are the sole respondents.



Use case -2
Poll app:
Description: create a web app or mobile app to help design a poll. This poll should be capable of generating questions with checkboxes, radio buttons or any other format specific to admin. 
User login: create basic details for the student. View the poll and answer the poll.
Admin: create a poll for the students and fetch the students poll results in excel sheet or any format specific to admin,with their basic details fetched.
Set the reminder for the poll to be completed and automatically disable the poll after the deadline. 
The student who receive the poll must be able to view the deadline of the poll and a reminder may be set for the student to answer the poll in their portal. 
When tracking the results of the poll, time of poll must be extracted. If a student has student but it isn’t reflected in a poll then create a mechanism to capture the screenshot for the student to defend himself. 
Creativity to this app is welcome and seamless functionality is expected in this use case



Use case-3
Coding community:
We coders are facing lot of errors in installation of software, working on some code or working in some project. A student friendly community to handle this is required.
Description: create a web app which is more preferable, that can handle the requests made by the student.
 Create two users, Developers and coders. 
Developers are those who can sign up as mentors or experts that have 3 projects under their belt , an intern experience may be added advantage to get him signed up as developer.
Create a hierarchy of skillset for him that he can address the challenges and rectify it.
Coders: this community can be a student who is aspiring to learn, the one who is beginner to coding and is willing to learn something. Essentially you can have the skillset fetched from the coder and create a pattern that can match the queries to the developer who has expertise in it. 
Creativity in this web app is welcome.
One suggestion in this app would be the detailed chain of problem solution in a single thread. 
Percentage of problem solution by the developer can be appreciated and put into top solutions.



Use - Case-4
Content management system:
Sometimes a learner doesn’t know where to start, but peers like you can guide him through the process and the resources that you had before.
Description:
Create a website that can take the input from the user who is essentially a student. Fetch the basic details of the student, get to know what does he/she  aim to learn? Depending on the skillset available with him/her and the stack that they wish , guide them through a roadmap.
This website must have a tool design framework that can create chunks of the entire roadmap into modules.
Thea modules can be organised into few parts which can be broad topics, their resources and platforms where can they can find them. Walkthrough for the platform for a beginner can be provided as a flash card or any other effective ways.
After the beginner gets the design of the content in form of roadmap and resources, a track sheet can be charted for the student.
Now here comes this interesting idea,
  When the tracker has been created, like minded students or the ones going through the same process can be inter linked via a platform where they can have live chat or exchange conversations or information via some means to help each other out. In this way , they can collaborate and study. 
But to honour their timings ,this collaboration section can be thought as a request response type while creating this module. The request to be accepted by the student who is doing the same process. 
One fact is if these students are brought under one collaborative umbrella and that is they can have the facilities to code together or see their study at the same time like screen share, they can effectively create a peer environment of learning amongst themselves.
Creativity is welcome.
The contents can be a broad subject on which the current trends and domain is included.
Your creativity is welcome and if you wish to reduce the complexity level of this idea, then that is too welcomed



Use case -5: 
Code efficiency analyzer:
Everyone is coding and learning to make it more efficient in due course of time.
Can you design a tool that can take the code and predict the efficiency of the code in terms of time and space complexity.
If yes then it must be possible for a genius like you to suggest some changes to the code that can yield better time complexity



**Use Case -6**
**Resume generator:**
**The need of the hour is a resume that can catch the eyes of the bot and bring you an inch closer to the interviewer.**
**Description:**
**Fetch the details from a student via different ways or whatever parameters you have to make it better.**
**Feed these details to a template and generate the resume.**
**Set a prebuild to this resume and display it to the user. Give a chance of customisation to the user. Once the user selects the resume then give it generate in various forms of document.**
**You can add scoring mechanism to this resume after its final generation. One more thing. In this era of Generative AI, you can design the resume generator to create a self introduction content based on the resume that you have designed. You can give this a voice assist and a facility to have your self intro link to your portfolio where the interviewer can click on that content and listens to it or better view and listen.**
**This can be web app or a mobile app. Choose to have templates only for engineering grads cause you can narrow down the problem statement and solution.**
